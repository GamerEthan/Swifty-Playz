    <h1>My Personal Top Games</h1>
    <h3>Last Light</h3>
    <p>This game man... is the greatest game of the decade!
      Last time I played a game as good as this was when I was playing Pokemon Ultra Moon on my Nintendo 3DS.
      The graphics are so retro and the art is so well done.
      The lore to the game is impeccable, couldn't of done it better myself.
      I highly recommend this game to everybody in the entire world... no... to everybody in the entire universe!<br>

      <h3>Detroit: Become Human</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Detroit Become Human developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on May 25, 2018 is a huge story based interactive-narrative game about future androids serving humans, yet having souls of their own.
      The game focuses on three main androids, Kara, Connor, and Markus.
      This game delves into the idea of moral choices, discrimination, racism, and the freedom of androids.
      It takes place in Detroit, Michigan in the year 2038.
      If you enjoy story based games, then I truly believe you will enjoy this game with all it has to offer.
      Their are many different endings you can get, so it keeps you engaged.
      To 100% the game, it will take one upto 50 hours! 50 hours of playing as an android in the future!
      Now that sounds amazing!
