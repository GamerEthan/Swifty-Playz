    <h2>About My Page</h2>
    <p>This webpage was created as a assignment in my high school AP Computer Science Principles class. 
      I could of designed it in Google Slides, but I like a challenge so I coded all this in HTML and CSS. 
      I chose to make the page about video game reviews because video games are a big part of my life, so this made this project more enjoyable.
      My game reviews will vary from AAA to indie, linear-based to open world, single-player to multiplayer, and so on.
      I will attempt to not add bias to my reviews, but I am human and I do have my own opinions, though I am open to other opinions; therefore, I will allow for comments on my reviews once I figure out how to do that, so you can give your own opinions on the game!
      Also, there will be zero spoilers in my reviews, so you can read them without worrying about spoilers.
      If you comment any spoilers on my reviews, then I will block your permission to comment on my reviews.
