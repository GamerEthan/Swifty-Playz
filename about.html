    <h2>About My Page</h2>
    <p>This webpage was created as a assignment in my high school AP Computer Science Principles class.</p>
    <p>I could of designed it in Google Slides, but I like a challenge so I coded all this in HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>I chose to make the page about video game reviews because video games are a big part of my life, so this made this project more enjoyable.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Ethan Sikes, and I am a 18 year old high school student.</p>
    <p>I enjoy coding and have been doing it since middle school.</p>
    <p>My favorite language to code in is Python because of it's simplicity.</p>
    <p>My favorite game engine to use is Godot because of it's simplicity.</p>
    <p>After all, I'm just a simplisitic guy.</p>
